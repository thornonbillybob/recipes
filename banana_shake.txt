1 banana (organic)
A dash of cinnamon
1 small pot of water

Preparation:
Cut the ends of the banana and add it to a pot of boiling water. Leave for 10 minutes, then pour the water through a colander into a tea cup. Add cinnamon to spice up your taste and you are good to enjoy!

This banana cinnamon tea should be consumed an hour before you go to sleep.

A big part of sleep is being well nourished and also welcoming relaxation. Bananas contain high amounts of vitamin C, fiber, potassium, and magnesium, and all of these minerals help nourish your body and encourage your muscles to relax, so the rest of the work is just about allowing yourself and your mind to quiet down. When you add cinnamon to the mix, not only are you making things taste great, but you are also adding another relaxation (and circulation and digestive) powerhouse into the mix.
